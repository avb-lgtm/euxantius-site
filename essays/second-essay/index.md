ESSAY: Of A Study in Indulgence


14/12/2025


My second girlfriend, whom I met in a grove behind the Abbey at the rear of my school, once appealed to me to attend her friend’s birthday party, hosted by a neighbour on a Church Lane not far from us.


Upon exiting this road, one would find a series of groves, some of which I and my acquaintances frequented with great enthusiasm (almost every week, at the very least).


It was here I discovered her particular affinity for the bottle—an affliction which, though I could not pretend to have escaped entirely myself (particularly on nights like this, where money and youth were a storm in a bottle), was dwarfed by hers. I was sympathetic however to the nature of her disorder.


Our youthful bank accounts ensured indulgence, yet even amongst us, her consumption was a lawless, almost performative excess.


In her desperately stricken state, she removed from her handbag a small bottle of perfume. Its smell was most attractive, for I had purchased it myself (and of perfume I have always considered myself to be of exquisite taste), yet I soon learned that perfume does not taste in one’s throat nearly as lovely or sweet as it smells on your sweetheart-of-the-time’s neck.


I had, up to that point in my life, been no stranger to potions, concoctions, or self-medicaments of all kinds. But I had always drawn the line at perfume. That line, however, was apparently arbitrary. My mind, ever awake, compelled me in pure curiosity to accept her trembling hand’s invitation.


I can remember the moment quite clearly; even with the trees swaying and the calls of my similarly commiserating companions ringing in my ears, encouraging me to return the bottle to her handbag and send her to bed, I knew fully well what I was doing. And they anticipated accurately in their shock, what I was just about to do, for I unscrewed the cap and took a shot. Of perfume. Instantly regrettable.


The drink itself, however, was beside the point. What mattered was that, even through the fog of alcohol (and other narcotics), curiosity outran disgust, and though I did something quite ridiculous, my mind remained alert enough to register the difference between indulgence and compulsion.


When I looked at her then—really looked, and it was now as clear as day—it was the first time I saw her without the softening effects of youth, beauty, desire, charm, or shared excess.


There was no romance in this pitiful scene; all I could see was a small, frightened, and deeply selfish gravity pulling everything toward itself. She drank not for pleasure, nor even for escape, but because it was the only way she knew to be present without thinking. She was running away from her own consciousness. She probably still is.


(For one is born attached to one’s conscious mind, whether it is convenient or not)


As if to wash away the repugnant taste, or perhaps as reward for my reckless (but socially condoned) curiosity, those around me offered a triple shot of vodka. Of course, I indulged.


—


Later, we all stumbled to my friend’s house, gathering at the back of his garden where a fire had been lit in a pit. We sat around the fire which we fed with beer and whatever else we could lay our weak hands on, and sat around it on benches which (for the purposes of this story) resembled logs. Seated, and with the occasionally roaring flames casting shadows across the rear of our dishevelled faces, a friend asked, half-exasperated:


—


“Why the fuck did you drink that?”


I took a moment to consider, for I had been thinking on this very question for the last hour: “I won’t do it again. But I… just had to know.”


—


The night continued in misery and cries of fake laughter. I kissed her, of course, thankfully the aftertaste of perfume elevated the far more repugnant taste of pure ethanol to which her lips were far more accustomed than I was.


Later, as the others left, staggering down the front drive, I watched from the upstairs window, before we dulled our minds further (in order to forget this miserable affair), and I couldn’t help but notice the grotesque choreography of intoxication.


And so it struck me, looking down at the departing shadows (how the ethanol transformed those beautiful beings in the shadows I was drawn to, into monsters lurching mindlessly away from me) that even in chaos, deduction remained possible.


Every step, every wobble, every habitual gesture, and concurrently, every deliberate stagger, every hand laid on a shoulder in faux care; their shadows spoke to expose exactly who they were, and I catalogued at the back of my mind all these discernments.


Though I could not quite access all I knew I could see with my eyes, at the time. For observation never sleeps, certainly not in my mind. The absurdity of their allegiances to one another and to the “fun” of their ‘game’; the sheer superficiality of their devotion struck me; the self-interest which drove all the gestures they made, all laid bare in the dawn of the night—laid bare by the effects of their drug of choice: alcohol.


They would forget it all in the morning; that night was but one of countless similar performances, and I was merely another participant.


So what of that girl? That night revealed what I had already begun to suspect: there was nothing special between us, no love, nothing unique. She was a stereotype of the privately educated teenage girl: alcoholic, needy, starved of self-love, self-esteem, and food. Yet, dependent, and self-absorbed.


Similar girls followed in my orbit afterward, each offering companionship, each predictable in the ways they sought indulgence, affection, and attention. I admittedly moved amongst them, as they moved among me, and none of it was exceptional— companionship freely available, but always filtered through the same cycles of need, desire, and performance.


Was it I orbiting them or was it something within me which drew them into my orbit?


—


I solved the case; plainly, she was anorexic, vapid, and dependent. None of the people around her (myself included) seemed to notice the absurdity of our participation in our little ‘game’.


Yet the game is never in the spectacle itself. The game begins when the clue is observed, which acts as a key to the subconscious mind; admitting patterns, which form and thus emerge from one’s disordered environment. For, that is when distinction between the ephemeral and the true is made. And the mind does this automatically, but it requires the right combination of stimuli to unpick what is otherwise aloof to oneself.


That night, however, the tipping point for me, and for my mind, unlike my companions, was derived not from the bottle, but rather from that very same innocuous-looking bottle of perfume earlier offered from a handbag.


The case, as Holmes would recognise, was already afoot—the case, here, being life. And the observer must decide whether to act, or merely watch as others continue to orbit the obvious, blind to their own folly.


I have observed enough now to know what is evident, what is predictable, and what is folly. Human nature remains as it has always been: I may well fall still, as is the way, for a figure of hollow beauty, either for her companionship, or curiosity, or both.


And yet, having seen clearly once, perhaps it was the under-appreciated, unrecognised intoxicating effects of the perfume I drank.


(I realise that is not a common practice).


But the nature of mankind is resolved to these same patterns of indulgence and self-interest which I observed then; I am no longer blind to the game as it plays itself before me. And I do not need to drink perfume to understand this now.


And so, even amidst the herd, and the blaze of intoxicated spirits, there was an exception which remained a quiet, constant and often under-appreciated presence; a presence of care, someone whose attention toward me had persisted despite all of this.


That being, I later came to appreciate: for it was myself, and my own mind. What I thought I had to run away from at the time, I now see I should have being striving towards; not away.


I am thankful to that lady for being my very own conductor of the moon’s light.


And I hope she too one day finds the peace offered by the illumination of her spirit.
