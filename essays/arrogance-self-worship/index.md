\# On The Arrogance of Human Self‑Worship and the Divine Stupidity of Tech Billionaires





28/09/2025





I read an FT article headline today beginning: “AI cannot create life, but…” which couldn’t help but remind me of a number of problems with human thought processes. Modern humanity prides itself on its intelligence, especially its apparent superiority in intelligence in comparison to “uncivilised” creators or “uncivilised” persons in their characteristics being too close to natural ones. Often this derogatory language is reserved for those not of a white, discoloured, and melanin-deprived complexion.





Its scientists and innovators speak as if they have surpassed all who came before, as if their laboratories and universities are temples of ultimate truth and from it they can even profess to derive justice, and yet scarcely derive little more than reams of beautified pieces of paper and yet more with god-complexes.





But why can none of them turn bread into wine? Conjure a grain of rice? Were it possible for magicians to do so, it is undoubtedly true that there would be as many Area 57 black sites as possible, dedicated to hosting wizards and witches abducted from tribes in the far East (or from whatever other lands in Africa they colonised, or even France) and have them wired up to machines, algorithms training on them, and they would sit with guns to their heads on assembly lines doing their “magic”.





They would be trying to reverse-genetically-engineer clones of these wizards and witches, which they would then, having absorbed their powers, put them on the backs of cargo planes and simply offer them a birds eye view of their enemies, and gold would be lifted from Iraq offering a chance at no threat to life other than all life there except their own.





Capitalism would find no mercy in its exploitation of them—but of course capitalism could only do so if it were possible. Instead, they try and imitate already existing life and matter as opposed to being so ambitious as to create matter from nothing.





Isaac Newton’s practices of alchemy ultimately yielded no fruit (or so I am led to believe).





But the fact they are instead pontificating on why they cannot resurrect the dead using computers, I will take to assume they haven’t harnessed the power of magic or alchemy yet, and likely never will (given how long it’s been that magic has been practiced on Earth).





Yet a closer look reveals within man’s arrogance a paradox: while mocking belief in a Creator beyond themselves, they build their entire intellectual life around imitation, often built upon the socially acceptable reverence for old men long dead, and pursuits that can never reach the heights of what already exists in nature.

Firstly it must be understood that such men have an obsession with knowing everything.





Today’s “rational” man insists: “I must know every fact, every mechanism, every particle. If I do not, I am incomplete.” But who imposed upon them this compulsion to know everything?The Quran is quite clear that human knowledge is, and will always be, partial:





“And of knowledge, you have been given only a little.” (17:85)





True wisdom lies not in the endless accumulation of knowledge, but in humility. In the recognition and appreciation that there are realities far beyond human comprehension. Yet the modern ego cannot bear this; it prefers the fantasy of eventual omniscience over the humility of admitting in the present that, “I do not know”

Secondly, one must understand the sheer arrogance at the heart of their disbelief





Disbelief is rarely a purely intellectual conclusion. It is, more often, spiritual arrogance predicated on the worship of one’s own ego. As Allah says:





“Have you seen O Prophet those who have taken their own desires as their god? And so, Allah left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing and hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. Who then can guide them after Allah? Will you all not then be mindful?” (45:23)





This “worship of the self” is precisely what drives the community of sneering at prophecy and any concept of revelation, for acknowledging a Creator would require surrendering their superficial thrones of their own pride.





I therefore deduce, that humans are only highly-capable imitators, but not originators





Despite their portraits and busts they worship (usually of themselves—this is often deemed to be ‘high art’) as self proclaimed ‘Gods’ of innovation, humans spend lifetimes copying only what already exists.





Leonardo da Vinci’s notebooks — which are still pored over five hundred years after his death — are sketches of wings, and gears, all in an attempt to mimic birds.





Today’s roboticists build tentacles inspired by octopuses, drones inspired by insects, AI models programmed to imitate human minds. Yet none of these can originate life and matter, nor perfect systems, and also originate them from nothing.





Flight is the most obvious example. For millennia humans watched birds and dreamed how to fly like them. Icarus was famously unsuccessful in his pursuit of becoming a human bird.





Only in the last century did they build airplanes, which are massive, fuel‑hungry machines that limp clumsily in comparison to a sparrow’s effortless and efficient flight, let alone master its self‑repair, navigation, and reproductive capacities. Even now, no one has built a machine that can fly endlessly without fuel, heal itself, and produce offspring. Humans can imitate but not originate.





One must also consider, in the plethora of evidence for God, the statistical impossibility of human “miracles”





If the powers known of and attributed to prophets (walking on water, turning Moses' staff into a serpant, the heat being withdrawn from a fire, splitting the Red Sea, calling water from wine) were simply a function of human genius, or ‘madness’ then in the billions of humans who have ever lived, we would statistically have had to see others do the same.





We would have entire lineages of people with such abilities, scattered across time and the geography of the planet. But the record of human history in this regard, is entirely nonexistent. The Archaeology industry has unearthed, pillaged, stolen, sold, and even destroyed (see the Rosetta Stone), all corners of the earth that their money and eccentricities could reach; no other “miracle worker” appears outside the ones already named by God.





This is not a coincidence, and indeed it is a proof of distinction: prophetic miracles are not human capacities; but rather they are divine gifts, which are non‑replicable by even the most brilliant mortal or supernaturally inclined ‘mad’ mind. As the Quran has preserved and honoured in its texts, a moment where he gave a response to the disbelievers who demanded of Muhammad (SAS) to conjure miracles of their choosing in order to prove that he really was a Prophet from God:





“Say: Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a mortal messenger?” (17:93)





It is also true that these disbelievers did not believe even after they saw miracles sent down divinely by God, just as they asked. It was never enough proof for them. So one must only conclude that they had no interest in being proven right, even as their demands for proof were answered.

The Mockery and hypocrisy of modern “rationalists”





Modern skeptics ridicule faithful believers for following “some man from a thousand years ago” — Muhammad or Jesus, and often included in these derogatory remarks are the terms ‘madman’ or ‘poet’ — yet they themselves are still studying and revering men long dead. Engineers still worship Da Vinci’s sketches; physicists re‑read Newton; technologists idolise Nikola Tesla. They mock prophets for being followed, but are themselves self described disciples of mortal men who could not even finish their own designs. Their entire innovation pipeline is parasitic on the insights of others.





They say: “You believe in a magic being in the sky who clicked his fingers and made man from clay?” Well, yes. And you — with your laboratories and degrees — cannot click your fingers and produce even a grain reminiscent of life. After all these millennia, you cannot do what you mock. Yet you demand God’s miracles be subject to your laboratory tests.

It can only be understood therefore that they have misplaced priorities, and completely misdirected awe.





These same individuals will devote lifetimes to an unsolved mathematics problem, or die trying to crack a conjecture, or alternatively, spend decades on a machine that imitates an elephant’s trunk. Yet they will not once look up at the sky and ask, with sincerity, “Is someone there?” They consider worship of the Creator insane, but the lifelong pursuit of an unsolvable mathematical proof, or puzzle rational. The Quran describes them exactly, for such people are not anything new:





“They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.” (30:7)





“Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.” (57:20)

So how then does one distinguish between true intelligence and mere vapid, empty cleverness?





The Quran does not equate intelligence with data or technical skill. For true intelligence is in humility, in moral awareness, and in man’s recognition of one’s limits:





“The most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous.” (49:13)





Without humility, even the greatest genius is only an idolater of himself; a man forever polishing the mirror of his own ego.





It is important also for the intelligent man to be recognisant of their fellow human beings, and their rights and limits.





Therefore, The Quran is a truly incredible book, for it is eternally pre‑emptive wisdom.





The Quran anticipates eithin its verses every thought modern humans pride themselves on “discovering.” or having ever thought of, or that which they have ever questioned.





The Noble verses of the Quran encompass all reflections man has ever prided itself upon investigating; on rain, clouds, birds, ethics, hearts, and yes the limits of human knowledge.





Were a person illiterate but steeped only in the words of the Quran, he would possess a wisdom surpassing a person holding a dozen degrees. That the “illiterate man” of Arabia conveyed from his ‘mad’ mind, truths that the most brilliant minds today cannot surpass, is itself a miracle.





Indeed, Surah 96 “The Clot” was the first revelation to the final Prophet. Its first words are:





“Read, O Prophet, in the Name of your Lord Who created—created humans from a clinging clot.” (96:1-2)





Alaq, taken here to translate to mean ‘the embryo’ (resembles a leech). Or alternatively as elsewhere, the Quran mostly uses the word Maa (fluid/water) or more precisely, Nutfah, which is a “drop of sperm” (or “small drop of sperm”).





The Arabic language is far more encompassing in depicting the realities of life and worldly matters, than the English language could ever possibly try to replicate. But that is another matter.





Those who ridicule the Quran are not exposing its flaws, but rather only their own arrogance. Their sneers are also exactly foretold repeatedly in its preserved verses:





“So let them laugh a little; they will weep much as a recompense for what they used to earn.” (9:82)





So what may one conclude from all this? Namely, the arrogance of self‑worship, the obsession with mastering nature, and the refusal to acknowledge the Creator form one pattern repeated throughout history, one which resembles only the folly of the human mind. Humanity’s cleverness is derivative, bounded, and continues to be, incomplete.





Humility therefore is the true mark of greatness.





The Prophetic miracles we all know of stand out precisely because they are not human capacities. The Quran remains unmatched in its wisdom therefore, precisely because it is not a human book.





Humility (especially before Allah) and the capacity for self-reflection, and the recognition of one’s limits are the highest markers of true insight. Without them, all “innovation” is just another form of idolatry; the worship of one’s own ego dressed up as ‘progress’.
